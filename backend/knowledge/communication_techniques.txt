ASSERTIVE COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES FOR DEBT RESOLUTION
=======================================================

ACTIVE LISTENING:
- Reflect back what the person has said to show understanding.
- Use phrases like "What I hear you saying is..."
- Allow pauses; don't rush to fill silence.

EMPATHETIC STATEMENTS:
- "I understand this situation is stressful."
- "Many people face similar financial challenges."
- "Your feelings about this are completely valid."
- "I'm here to help find a solution, not to judge."

DE-ESCALATION:
- Lower your voice when the other person raises theirs.
- Acknowledge frustration before presenting solutions.
- Avoid defensive language or blame.
- Use "we" instead of "you" to create partnership.

REFRAMING:
- Turn "you owe $X" into "there's an opportunity to resolve $X."
- Turn "you're past due" into "there are programs available right now."
- Focus on future benefit, not past failure.

BOUNDARY SETTING:
- "I want to help you. Let's keep this conversation productive."
- "I respect your feelings. I also need to share some important information."
- "If now isn't a good time, when would be better to continue?"

CLOSING TECHNIQUES:
- Summarize what was discussed.
- Confirm next steps clearly.
- Express confidence in the resolution path.
- Leave the door open for follow-up.
